<h1>Potato Wedges</h1
<p>This recipe is perfect for busy weeknights because it’s so quick and easy to prepare and they taste like what you get from restaurants and pubs even though this is made in the oven and not deep fried.</p>

<strong>And at just 165 calories for a big satisfying helping – what more could you want?</strong>
<p><b>Why This Recipe Works:</b></p>
<p>Roasting the potatoes at a high heat makes the potato wedges soft and fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.</p>
<p>The combination of spices adds a kick of flavor without the hassle of chopping garlic and onions.</p>
<p>Using low-fat cooking spray makes them less oily in taste and much healthier.</p>
<p>The flavors used makes them a versatile side dish that works with anything from fish to steak.</p>
<b>How to Make Seasoned Baked Potato Wedges:</b>
<p>Start by washing the potatoes to get rid of any dirt (there’s no need to peel them). </p> <p>Then cut each potato in half lengthwise, cut each half into 2-4 wedges (depending on size) so that you end up with 6-8 wedges from each potato.</p>
