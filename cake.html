<p>Fresh Blueberry Cake with Cream Cheese Icing Perfection</p>
<b>What’s the one thing that sets this Blueberry cake apart from others?</b>
<p> The rich taste of the cream cheese that’s mixed right into the batter. It’s the perfect pairing with the fresh blueberries. </p>

<b>Why This Recipe Works:</b>
<p>The cream cheese baked into the cake not only adds moisture but flavor too.
The thick batter helps keep the blueberries from sinking to the bottom of the cake.</p>
<p>The cream cheese icing is the perfect way to finish off this luscious cake.</p>

<p>Making Blueberry Cake with Frozen Blueberries: 

<p>To prevent your frozen blueberries bleeding into the batter,  don’t leave them out to defrost, instead rinse the frozen blueberries to defrost them.</p>
<p>Rinse the blueberries in cold water several times until they are defrosted, and the water is relatively clear when you drain them.</p> <p> As they defrost, the water may start out dark blue, but will gradually lighten to a watery reddish blue. </p>
<p>Dry the blueberries well with paper towels by spreading them out evenly on them and pressing another layer on top.</p> <p> Press gently and leave until you need them. 
<p>Before adding the defrosted blueberries to the batter, coat them on a tablespoon of flour (be sure to stir gently when folding them into the batter).</p>
<p>Start with softening the butter and cream cheese together in the microwave until very soft, but not completely melted.</p>

<p>Next, mix all the wet ingredients and sugar with the cream cheese mixture until combined.</p>

<p>To make the cream cheese icing, start with melted butter and softened cream cheese.Add powdered sugar, vanilla and some milk (I used 3 tablespoons because I like my icing a little thick).</p>
